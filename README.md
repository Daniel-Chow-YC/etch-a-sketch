# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

- In this project I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Note:
- result of ``.querySelector()`` is not live, so when we dynamically add an element that matches a selector, the collection wonâ€™t update.
- document.getElementsByClassName() is an HTMLCollection, and is live.
